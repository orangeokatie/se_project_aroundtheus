**Intro**

This project is "Around the US." The website is built using HTML5 and CSS functions. The project contains the landing page as a profile for explorer Jacques Cousteau. He has an editable profile and photos of locations. The photos are set up in a grid structure and have stylized "like" buttons. The website is responsive and can respond to a variety of screensizes with CSS rules in place regarding overlapping of content.

This project can be found hosted online at: https://orangeokatie.github.io/se_project_aroundtheus/
