# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is "Around the US." The website is built using HTML5 and CSS functions. The project contains the landing page as a profile for explorer Jacques Cousteau. He has an editable profile and photos of locations. The photos are set up in a grid structure and have stylized "like" buttons. The website is responsive and can respond to a variety of screensizes with CSS rules in place regarding overlapping of content.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
